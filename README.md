# csharp_ACII_art_maker

This is just a really simple ASCII art generator I wrote in c# while I was bored and procrastinating on work.
It works with whatever image is compatable with the Image class from System.Drawing.

The idea behind this little project is kinda like a step 0 to writing an ASCII art generator in c++, seeing in a general sense how to make an ASCII generator and trying stuff in a language I'm familiar with.
I eventually plan to write something similar to this in c++ as I really want to learn the language properly and I thought it would be a fun project to do so.

For now I might update this here and there to improve the quality of the images to see what works and what doesn't
